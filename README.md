# Vibrant


### :question: About
Vibrant is a modern music player filled with all
the features you've been missing from other music players

#### What is this repo for?
* Hosting Vibrant's source code
* Tracking issues
* Tracking development
* Contribuiting

#### What is Vibrant made of?
Vibrant is a React Native app, built with Expo, using Typescript.

### :rocket: Plans
Vibrant at the moment is just a music player that grabs videos
from Youtube, strips the video and plays only the audio.

* Vibrant in the future might ship it's own private library of songs, 
with subscription fees but also a free plan.
* Vibrant is all about keeping it as free as possible.
* The source code will always be available for anyone to see and contribute to.
